Translunar Relocation of the International Space Station:

Transforming the ISS into the First Permanent Lunar Orbital Platform

Executive Summary
This proposal reimagines the long-term future of the International Space Station by transporting it from low-Earth orbit (LEO) into a stable lunar orbit, where it would serve as a fully functional lunar operations hub, precursor to surface base construction, and training platform for cis-lunar missions.
Although technically challenging, relocating the ISS could:
Extend the station’s legacy by a decade or more
Create an immediate, fully equipped lunar orbital research base
Enable complex assembly, testing, and coordination of lunar surface infrastructure
Reduce development pressure on newer stations like Gateway
Provide unprecedented scientific opportunities in cis-lunar space
This white paper outlines the conceptual feasibility, mission architecture, engineering challenges, and strategic benefits of relocating the ISS to lunar orbit.

1. Introduction: A Bold Extension of the ISS Legacy
The ISS is approaching the end of its planned operational life in LEO. Current deorbit plans envision controlled destruction in the 2030s. But the ISS still has functional modules, advanced life support systems, operational robotics, and a vast internal volume unmatched by any future station.
Instead of decommissioning the ISS, this proposal considers extending its life by relocating it to lunar orbit—transforming it into a cis-lunar laboratory, logistics hub, and assembly node for lunar surface infrastructure.

2. Strategic Rationale for Relocation

2.1 Immediate Capability for Lunar Operations
Once in lunar orbit, the ISS becomes:
The largest crewed outpost beyond low-Earth orbit
A construction and staging platform for surface missions
A training and medical bay for extended lunar stays
A waystation for deep-space missions
A depot for supplies, fuel, and equipment

2.2 Cost and Time Efficiency
Compared to building a new cis-lunar station:
Habitat volume already exists
Life support systems already tested
International integration already established
Robotic systems already available
A relocated ISS provides an “instant lunar Gateway”—with far more room.

2.3 Extending the ISS Legacy
Instead of burning up in Earth’s atmosphere, the ISS:
Continues supporting science for another decade
Becomes humanity’s first major structure beyond LEO
Serves as a symbolic and practical stepping stone to Mars

3. Mission Architecture: How to Move a 420-Ton Station to the Moon
This section outlines a conceptual approach only—details would depend on actual engineering studies.

3.1 Required Modifications Before Departure
Reinforcement of structural trusses to survive prolonged burns
Radiation shielding upgrades for crewed lunar transfer (flexible polymer-silicate composites inside)
Replacement or reinforcement of aging power systems
Docking interfaces compatible with multiple tugs

3.2 High-Thrust Chemical Tug Concept

The ISS will be relocated using three docked chemical tugs attached to the Russian segment, providing three thrust vectors for:
	•	Maximum maneuverability
	•	Distributed load along the truss
	•	Redundancy in the event of a tug failure
	•	Integrated attitude control through differential thrust

Proposed docking ports:
	•	Zvezda aft
	•	Zvezda nadir
	•	Zarya aft or nadir

Advantages:
	•	Proven, reliable, fully docked chemical propulsion
	•	High thrust enables relatively short mission durations
	•	Full controllability with redundant thrust vectors
	•	Maintains structural safety by minimizing truss bending and torque loads

Beyond the three suggested ports, the propulsion architecture can make use of additional docking interfaces, allowing the tugs to be reconfigured between thrust-aligned positions for major translational burns and off-axis positions for rotational control. This flexibility enables both large-scale ∆v maneuvers and precise attitude tuning while minimizing structural stress.

All tugs remain fully serviceable and may return to Earth—or to an intermediate servicing orbit—for refueling, refurbishment, or replacement.


4. Engineering Feasibility Challenges

4.1 Structural Integrity
The ISS was never designed to be accelerated as a single rigid spacecraft.
Key concerns:
High stress on trusses
Harmonics during burns
Module connection loads Mitigation: distributed propulsion and slow spiral trajectories.

4.2 Power and Thermal Constraints
The solar arrays must withstand:
Long-distance temperature cycles
Different solar incidence angles
Far less Earth-albedo heating

4.3 Radiation Exposure
Outside Earth’s magnetosphere, the ISS must be upgraded with
Flexible polymer-silicate composites as radiation shielding from inside

4.4 Maintaining Station Attitude
Reaction wheels & CMGs may need augmentation with:
Dedicated propulsion reaction control
New control moment gyros optimized for deep space

5. Benefits of the ISS in Lunar Orbit

5.1 Lunar Habitat Assembly Bay
Use the spacious ISS modules to:
Preassemble lunar surface equipment
Test landing vehicle interfaces
Train astronauts before surface deployment
Store critical spares

5.2 Science and Observation
Lunar exosphere research
Far-side radio astronomy support
Space weather monitoring
Closed-loop life support experiments in deep space

5.3 International Collaboration Hub
Expand multinational lunar participation
Serve as a neutral, shared asset
Provide docking for commercial landers and crew vehicles

5.4 Stepping Stone to Mars
A fully operational cis-lunar station provides:
Radiation-protected crew quarters
Test environment for Mars-class life support
A depot for fuel and components

6. Policy, Legal, and International Considerations
Relocating the ISS to lunar orbit requires:
Updated intergovernmental agreements
New operational jurisdiction frameworks
Commercial access protocols
Shared costs and responsibilities across the ISS partners

A new governance body—ISS-Lunar—could coordinate responsibilities.

7. Cost, Risk, and Programmatic Considerations

7.1 Cost Drivers
Propulsion modules
Structural reinforcement
New guidance & navigation systems
Radiation protection layers
Logistics for the transfer

7.2 Risk Categories
Structural failure during burns
Propulsion malfunction
Power system degradation
Crew safety (uncrewed transfer is preferred)
Station-keeping in a halo orbit

8. Conclusion: A Vision Worth Studying
Moving the ISS to lunar orbit is not conventional.
It is not “safe.”
It is not easy.

But it is conceptually possible.

And most importantly—it represents the kind of bold, system-level thinking that pushes human spaceflight forward.

Instead of ending its life in Earth’s atmosphere, the ISS could be reborn as:
The first great cis-lunar space station
An anchor for lunar surface development
A research hub beyond low-Earth orbit
A living monument to international cooperation

This concept deserves careful study—not because it is simple,
but because its ambition matches the scale of our future in space

Musk sent a roadster to orbit. We could send the entire ISS to the Moon. Three docked chemical tugs, three thrust vectors, fully controlled. No waste, all science, maximum audacity.
